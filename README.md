# This is my very first web site!

## Welcome!

I am currently studying with the Code Institute, currently undertaking the
Full Stack Web Developer Diploma.  I have covered HTML and CSS so far and I
hope this website will give a good indication of the quality of work I can
produce.

The following website is in three pages.  The first page, labelled index.html
and the second and third, called stream-two.html and stream-3.html.  Also
attached is the CSS file and this README file.

The purpose of the website is to gain understanding of some of the languages
and programs used in website development.  You simply click on either the icon
or the label and it will direct you to the relevant wikipedia page.  There are
six links on each page.

Again, I hope you enjoy my work and look forward to publishing more in the near
future!
